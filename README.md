`Footprint-Database` is a dataset of footprint images of 21 individuals captured using flatbed scanner and 32 individuals with the dactloscopic images (including left and right footprint).

## Why we made Footprint-Database
Human footprint is one of the relatively new physiological biometrics due to its stable and unique characteristics. The texture and foot shape information of footprint offers one of the powerful means in personal recognition.

## How to use this dataset.
### Basic image pre-proceessing on the footprint images to perform feature extraction

## To Serious Machine Learning Researchers
For those who are interested to explore the domain of biomtrics and implement a human identification system using footprint images can make uses of following research in which we used this database.
